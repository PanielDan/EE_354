We're running the desing at the full 50MHz Clock. We use the debouncers to provide a delay
to fixes any errors and glitches.

Asumming that in 50MHz, there are 50,000,000 full clock cycles and we're not account for
debouncing (The debouncer is manually setting the pulse time to 1.342sec).

Then 50,000,000/4 = 12,500,000 times A/B is loaded during one press.

I dvided by 4 because there's 50M clocks in a second, so in 0.25 seconds, there's a fourth of that

I would use a 4-bit counter b/c with 16 individual flipflops, we would need 16 pieces of
condiitional logic to increment them. We could simply increment the counter everytime we
enter in a value and let then reset it back to 0 when it reaches 16--or just let it overflow.
16 Flip Flops take much more space and are more expensive than a simple 4-bit counter that does
the job. In addition we would waste 16 FFs to use as flags for a single state.
